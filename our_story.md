We met in the fall of 2010 at Frostburg State University. And started dating the next January. Matt graduated in 2014 and worked in Balitmore while Laura finished her degree and graduated in 2015.

After graduation, we went to Savage River Lodge for dinner together with our families where Matt proposed.

We then moved to Hampden in Baltimore where Matt, shortly after, started a new job with Terbium Labs. Laura started her Master's Degree in Special Education at Notre Dame of Maryland University. 

Once we got settled, our family grew by one when we adopted Hamilton from the Maryland SPCA in July of 2016.
