Our church and judge wedding will occur in Laura's home state of Bavaria.

Bavaria is the largest state in Germany and still has very deep traditions, the most well known of which is Oktoberfest. It's also well known for the fairytale castle Neuschwanstein, the inspiration for Disney castle.

Our church ceremony will be held in Eggenthal with a scenic view of the Alps and dates back to 1645. After the church ceremony, we will gather in the Parkhotel Residence in Bad Wörrishofen.

The reception will be held at the <a href="http://www.parkhotel-residence.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parkhotel Residence</a> and offer rooms you can book.

There are also other hotels which offer accommodations in the same town.

### Getting There: ###

Bad Wörrishofen has a train station within walking distance to the hotels, so we recommend flying into Munich and taking the train to Bad Wörrishofen.

You can buy tickets at <a href="//www.bahn.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bahn.de</a>.  
From: **München Flughafen Terminal**  
To: **Bahnhof, Bad Wörrishofen**

Google Chrome should be able to translate the page for you. But if not, <a href="/img/bahn-example.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> is an example of how you might want to fill out the search form.

There will be a shuttle from the Parkhotel Residence to the church for the ceremony and back.
